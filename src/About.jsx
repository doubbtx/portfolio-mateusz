          Hi, I'm <strong>Mateusz Kapel</strong>, a 22-year-old self-taught{" "}
          <strong>Front-end developer</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy creating websites that look good and work well, focusing
          on clean design and smooth user experiences.

          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I started my journey as a developer out of curiosity and a passion for problem-solving. Over time, I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I continue to expand my skill set through online courses, projects, and collaboration with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my craft, whether it's learning new frameworks or focusing on best practices in web performance and accessibility.
